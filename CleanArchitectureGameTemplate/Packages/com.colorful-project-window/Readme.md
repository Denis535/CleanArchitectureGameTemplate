# Overview
This package makes the project window much more convenient. This colors the special folders (modules, assets, resources and sources) in different colors, thus making the project window easier to use and greatly reducing cognitive load.

# How it works
This identifies special folders according to the following rules:
- Module folder must contain '*.asmdef' or '*.asmref' files.
- Assets folder must start with 'Assets' or 'Assets.*' prefix.
- Resources folder must start with 'Resources' or 'Resources.*' prefix.
- Source folder is just any other folder.

# How to use it
Just install this package.

# Setup
You can setup colors in 'Preferences/Colorful Project Window'.
